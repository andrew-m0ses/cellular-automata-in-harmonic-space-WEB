React component that maps up-to-4-dimensional cellular automata to rational harmonic space with over 4,000-voice polyphony.

UI includes controls for rule type, dimension, grid size, timing, harmonic ratio multiple for individual axes, origin frequency, and even an arpeggiation function !

The hypothesis is that cellular automata are an apt algorithm to apply to rational harmonic space; since both hinge on neighbor states. Cellular automata propagate according to neighbor states; and neighbor states are a condition of coherence in rational intonation.
